# Travelingo

Welcome to Travelingo, a site for quickly learning basics of the language you need to know for your travels!

Users can sign up, learn words and phrases associated with parts of their travel experience. 

The site is currently set up to work for basic French, with plans to expand to Portuguese and Vietnamese. 

Deployed at travelingo.herokuapp.com. Some issues exist with the styling/animations on the site, and are being worked on.
